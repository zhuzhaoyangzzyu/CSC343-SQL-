For an election, the participation ratio (a value between zero and one) is the ratio of votes cast to the
number of citizens who are eligible to vote. Find the countries that had at least one election between 2001
to 2016, inclusive, and whose average election participation ratios during this period obey the following: for
a pair year Y1 and year Y2, where at least one election has happened in each of them, if Y1 < Y2, then
the average participation in year Y1 is â‰¤ the average participation in year Y2. (If more than one election
happens in a country in a year, we calculate the participation ratio as the average participation ratio across
those elections.) For such countries, report the name of the country and the average participation ratio per
year for the years between 2001 to 2016.
